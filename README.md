## Description

In this competition, we are being challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. We have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 10,000 tweets, each labeled as either related to a real disaster or not. This labeled data will be used to train and evaluate the machine learning models.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets based on their content, distinguishing between real disaster-related tweets and unrelated ones.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Load the dataset and explore the data.
4. Preprocess the data as needed.
5. Train your machine learning model.
6. Evaluate the model's performance.
7. Iterate and improve the model.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, depending on the model)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CLS-05.git
cd CLS-05
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv('path_to_dataset.csv')
    ```

2. Preprocess the data and train your model:
    ```python
    # Your preprocessing and training code here
    ```

3. Evaluate the model:
    ```python
    # Your evaluation code here
    ```
